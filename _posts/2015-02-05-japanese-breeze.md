## They can't stop you!

Under Toronto’s Noise Bylaw, playing acoustic drums is allowed until 11 p.m. at
night, ensuring a fair balance between personal enjoyment and neighborhood
tranquility. The bylaw allows individuals to engage in their passions during
reasonable hours, giving drummers the freedom to express themselves and practice
as long as it doesn’t cause ongoing disruption.

Interestingly, since bylaw enforcement typically requires about an hour to
respond to a noise complaint, drummers have a unique window to play. For
example, they could potentially play at high volumes for 30 minutes *100 dbs*. By the time
authorities arrive to investigate, the activity would likely have ended, making
it feasible to plan around this response time and enjoy up to an hour of daily
practice without interference. This approach highlights the flexibility within
the current enforcement process for drummers to make the most of their time.
