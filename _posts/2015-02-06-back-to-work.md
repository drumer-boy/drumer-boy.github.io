## Make Impact


The goal of drummer rent control is to empower tenants to take control of the units around them, creating a collective influence to ensure the rental market works in their favor. By uniting as a community and leveraging creative strategies like persistent drumming protests, tenants can pressure landlords to maintain affordable rents and fair housing practices, effectively reshaping the power dynamics in their favor.

Drummer rent control is a bold and creative approach to addressing the housing crisis and advocating for affordable rents. The concept revolves around drummers uniting to form a “sphere of influence,” using their rhythmic talents as a powerful form of protest. The idea is to play loudly and persistently, drawing attention to the urgent need for fair housing practices and lower rents. This unique tactic brings both sound and visibility to an issue that affects countless people.

By refusing to stop drumming until landlords agree to lower rents or implement fairer housing policies, this movement creates a sense of urgency and accountability. The constant drumming serves as a peaceful yet unignorable protest, compelling property owners to reconsider exploitative rent practices. It also turns the collective frustration of tenants into a unified and impactful statement.

This initiative is about more than just noise—it’s about community, solidarity, and innovation. Drummers coming together for a shared cause demonstrate how creative action can challenge systemic issues like housing inequality. By transforming sound into a call for change, they amplify the conversation around rent control and inspire others to rethink how activism can be both effective and unconventional.
